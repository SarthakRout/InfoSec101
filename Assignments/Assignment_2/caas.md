Challenge Page: [caas](https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/)

## Walkthrough
How did you solve this level? Include the complete thought process, even stuff that didn't work. Give explanations wherever necessary.
I opened the challenge page. There was a link on the page, I gone through it. Changing the message in the link printed that message on the.It therefore looked similar to using an echo command on linux command line.I earlier had inspected the page but got nothing therefore I now thought that if the link is like a command line I can list all files present there using ls command.As I thought there was a falg.txt file which I opened and got the flag. 

## Flag
`picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}`

## Useful resources (if any)

## Suggested modifications [Optional]
What can you do to make this level more difficult. The inherent idea should be similar.
