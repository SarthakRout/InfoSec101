# Web Exploitation

> ## SQL Injection

 (SQL Query is a condition)

- `Classical` - Code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution such as using boolean logic to override WHERE clauses.
- `Error Based SQLi` - Verbose error output from the SQL database is used to retrieve confidential data from the database revealed by evaluation of some part of query.
- `Blind SQLi` - Brute force SQL Injection attack that depends on whether one can distinguish whether the query executed successfully (by HTTP response or verbose error output). The query enumerates all possibilities of characters of the entry that we want to retrieve one by one by asking checking prefixes. The entry is determined based on the applications response.
- `Time Based SQLi` - Sending a SQL query to the database which forces the database to wait for a specified amount of time (in seconds) before responding if some condition is satisfied (the prefix of the entry is "pdfg", length of table "EMP_DATA" < 10 etc).

> ## XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

- `Persistent XSS` - We inject malicious payload to the database, which is rendered everytime the user accesses that entry. The payload executes in context of the webapp on behalf of the user and sends confidential data to the attacker's server.
- `Reflected XSS` - Force the user to click on some link which contains some malicious script which is shown by the webapp as such without sanitisation allowing the script to steak cookies or session data.

> ## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

Forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. The user is coerced into clicking a link with malicious payload which sends a request to the server. As the cookies are automatically attached by the browser, the server is not able to distinguish it as an illegitimate request.

> ## XXE (XML External Entity)

Web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code to a web application using XML to retrieve confidential data, cause DDoS attack, Remote Code Execution etc using external entities in XML. 
> ## Directory Traversal (Local file inclusion)

Attack which allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server's root directory.
